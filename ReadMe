Portfolio-Website


I started to create my very own portfolio website where I would like to present myself and my projects.

Please, be aware, that the website is still under construction, so there is a high chance that a few things not will work as it should. At the moment I was focusing to build up the base form of the website and I will fill up with content later on!
I started to build the website on 04/07/2023, so it is still in a very early stage.

To open the website, please use this link: https://rawcdn.githack.com/Gabev90/Portfolio-Website/feaa68b790657b05c0f38f187d13b09e0a1ea3cb/index.html
